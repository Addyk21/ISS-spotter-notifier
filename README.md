The ISS (International Space Station) travels at 28,165 kilometers per hour! Since it reflects light, its possible to spot it at night.
This script takes your location (latitude, longitude) as input and checks whether the ISS in near you, then using the sunset and sunrise timings at your location, if it's dark outside: you will receive a mail notification.
